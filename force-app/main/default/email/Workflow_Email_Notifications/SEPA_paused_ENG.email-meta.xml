    <subject>Your SEPA Direct Debit Mandate has been paused</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.SF_BillTo_Contact__c},

Since your last two direct debit payments to us could not be collected, we are forced to pause your SEPA Direct Debit Mandate immediately until further notice.

What does it mean and what do I have to do now?

In the past, your account has two times not been sufficiently covered for our outstanding claims. These bounced transactions have unfortunately cost us money. In order to avoid such costs in the future, we have to pause your SEPA Direct Debit Mandate.

Tip: If you still have outstanding invoice amounts, please transfer the outstanding amounts to our bank account with the corresponding invoice number within five working days. This will save you a dunning procedure with additional fees!

If your next four payments or transfers go smoothly, feel free to send an email to help@orderbird.com and we will reactivate your SEPA Direct Debit Mandate after a brief verification.

Your payments did go through? This is just a misunderstanding?

If you are of the opinion that your direct debit mandate is working smoothly and there are no failed payments, please contact us as soon as possible. This will give us a chance to solve this inconvenience together. You can reach us by email at help@orderbird.com anytime. Please use &quot;SEPA Direct Debit Mandate falsely paused&quot; as subject line.

Thank you for your understanding.
