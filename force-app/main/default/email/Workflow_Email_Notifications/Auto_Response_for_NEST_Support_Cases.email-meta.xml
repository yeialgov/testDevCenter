    <subject>Your message didn&apos;t reach us</subject>
    <textOnly>Quick reminder that as of mid January 2018 nest@orderbird.com is no longer supported!



With the restructure of NEST into CDS we revised and stream-lined our process of handling requests from colleagues. A small downside: we no longer process email requests here.



Instead we have a simplified ticketing system with only two ticket types that are valid for all our systems:

1. Incidences: Something doesn’t do what it is supposed to do and needs quick fixing  2. Story: Some new function or feature in one of our systems is required



To conveniently create one of those just click “Report Incident” or “Submit Story” on https://wiki.orderbird.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=14850879 (Bookmark this page!)



Thanks and best regards,

your CDS-Team</textOnly>
